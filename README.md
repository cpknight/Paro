# `Paro` - _personal autonomous reconnaissance observer_

_Current Status_: **`PARO RC1 DEVICES` have `COMPLETED PRODUCTION` and are `READY FOR SHIPPING`.**

<img src="content/PARO-019P-reference-800px.png" border="1" />

Paro devices enable autonomous intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activities in remote and harsh environments, including from aerial vehicles. They are currently in initial production for an open (public) [beta-testing](https://www.howtogeek.com/758686/what-is-beta-testing/) program. **You can participate in the beta program - please contact [chris@cpknight.io](mailto:chris@cpknight.io) for details.**

## ABOUT PARO &ndash;

Paro is a "Personal Autonomous Reconnaissance Observer" device - it's a simple black box that observes the world around it, and reports what it sees back to you. It's a _personal_ device designed to help you out with its various sensors, so that you can sense things that you might not be able to on your own, or so it can make observations while you're not around. It does this _autonomously_ so you don't have to monitor it all the time while your attention is elsewhere. And it's loaded with _reconnaissance_ algorithms that have been created (and adopted) so that you can choose from a long list of _observations_ that Paro can make for you. 

<br />

## PARO BETA PROGRAM &ndash;

Paro is still under development, but this is the "release candidate" hardware that will become the final product. Participating in the beta program means that you'll be able to make your mark on the final stages of Paro's development, as we test it in the "real world"! We really want to put Paro through its paces (and "beat it up") through this beta-testing program. Accordingly, we want to make it worth the while of participants. 

Participants in the beta program get: (1) the current Paro hardware (`RC1`); (2) the right to exchange the current Paro RC device for any future "release candidate" devices (`RC2`, `RC3`, `RC4`...) as they are released; (3) the right to exchange for the final, production version of Paro; (4) a 15% "beta tester" discount on accessories related to Paro (when they are released); (5) access to a "Paro" Discord server during the Beta program; and (6) an optional acknowledgment to you physically imprinted on the inside case of the final Paro release, along with a special acknowledgement in Paro's firmware.

We're aiming for a maximum of 50 "at large" participants in the beta testing program, which is subject to participants' agreement of the [Paro Beta Testing Agreement](content/PARO-RC1-Beta-Testing-Agreement.md).
