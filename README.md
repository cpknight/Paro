# `Paro` - _personal autonomous reconnaissance observer_

_Current Status_: **`PARO RC1 DEVICES` have `COMPLETED PRODUCTION` and are `READY FOR SHIPPING`.**

Paro devices enable autonomous intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activities in remote and harsh environments, including from aerial vehicles. They are currently in initial production for an open (public) [beta-testing](https://www.howtogeek.com/758686/what-is-beta-testing/) program. **You can participate in the beta program - please contact [chris@cpknight.io](mailto:chris@cpknight.io) for details.**

## ABOUT PARO &ndash;

Paro is a "Personal Autonomous Reconnaissance Observer" device - it's a simple black box that observes the world around it, and reports what it sees back to you. It's a _personal_ device designed to help you out with its various sensors, so that you can sense things that you might not be able to on your own, or so it can make observations while you're not around. It does this _autonomously_ so you don't have to monitor it all the time while your attention is elsewhere. And it's loaded sensors and _reconnaissance_ algorithms that I've created (and adopted) so that you can choose from a long list of _observations_ that Paro can make for you.

## PARO BETA PROGRAM &ndash;

Paro is still under development, but this is the "release candidate" hardware that will become the final product. Purchasing this product allows you to participate in the final stages of development of Paro, as we test it in the "real world"!

Participating in Paro RC1 Beta Testing gets you: (1) the current Paro hardware (RC1); (2) the right to exchange your Paro for any future "release candidate" device (RC2, RC3, RC4...) as they are released; (3) the right to exchange your Paro for the final, production version of Paro; (4) a 15% "beta tester" discount on accessories related to Paro (when they are released); (5) access to a "Paro" Discord server during the Beta program; and (6) an optional acknowledgment to you physically imprinted on the inside case of the final Paro release, along with an acknowledgement in Paro's firmware.

Participation in the Beta Testing Program is open to a maximum of 50 "at large" participants, and is subject to your agreement to the Paro Beta Testing Agreement.
