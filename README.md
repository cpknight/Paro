# `Paro` - _personal autonomous reconnaissance observer_

Paro devices enable autonomous intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activities in remote and harsh environments, including from aerial vehicles. They are currently in initial production for an open (public) [beta-testing](https://www.howtogeek.com/758686/what-is-beta-testing/) program. **You can participate in the beta program - please contact [chris@cpknight.io](mailto:chris@cpknight.io) for more information.**
